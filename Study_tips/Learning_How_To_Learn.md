# Modes of Learning

There are two modes of thinking called the Focus mode and the Diffuse mode defined in bold below. 
In order to learn, you must be able to switch between both modes.

## Diffuse Mode := type of thinking required to learn something new (broad learning)

Your mind can enter the diffused mode by taking a step back and looking at the big picture of what you're trying to learn. 
The goal is to get a general feel of what you're trying to learn without looking at all of the details that complicate it.

Methods:
  1. Look at the big picture.
  2. Picture walk := when reading a new chapter or section, skim ahead and look at the pictures and main ideas. 

## Focus Mode := type of thinking needed to solve a problem step by step

Your mind can enter the focused mode when you try to solve a specific problem and look at all of details required to solve the problem.

# Study Techniques

## Pomodoro Technique:

The pomodoro technique is used to learn something new while avoiding procrastination. 
In summary, it requires cycles of concentrated studying for a period of time, followed by a short break, and then a small reward. 
Before you begin, minimize the distractions around you. 
That means if it's possible, go to a quiet place and remove anything distracting, especially devices. 
During the pomodoro, your focus should be on spending your best effort actively learning for 25 minutes. 
Your focus should not be about the end result because you may not be able to complete your task in 25 minutes. 
Over enough pomodoro's, the task will be complete as a side effect.

Requires: 

1. A timer*. 

*If you don't have a timer, search online or in an app store for "Pomodoro timer".

How it works:

1. Start a timer countdown for 25 minutes.

2. Actively focus on learning during the 25 minutes.

3. After the 25 minutes is done, start a timer countdown for 5 minutes and use that time as a break to do something you enjoy.

4. Congratulations, you completed a pomodoro. If you want to do another, go to step 1.

Additional Notes:

If you get distracted during your pomodoro for an extended period of time, restart the timer and start over. That one didn't count.

If you remember to do something important that can wait until after the pomodoro, make a note of it and fo back to focusing on studying.
