-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Background Information

## Memory

### Working memory := typically stores 3-4 chunks temporarily. It is like an inefficient mental blackboard where chalk fades over time.

### Long term memory := stores memory long term (not indefinitely). May take time to access memory that wasn't repeated

### Spaced Repetition := practicing the same concept over several days

You must use spaced repetition to transfer memories from working memory into long term memory. 

It is better to study something 20 times spaced out across a week instead of 20 times within a single day.

## Modes of Learning

There are two modes of thinking called the Focus mode and the Diffuse mode defined in bold below. 

In order to learn, you must be able to switch between both modes.

### Diffuse Mode := type of thinking required to learn something new

Your can enter the diffused mode by taking a step back and looking at the big picture of what you're trying to learn. 

The goal is to get a general feel of what you're trying to learn without looking at all the intricate details.

### Focus Mode := type of thinking needed to solve a problem step by step

Your can enter the focused mode when you try to solve a specific problem and look at all details required to solve the problem.

An analogy may be helpful for understanding why you need to switch between the modes of learning. To make a strong wall, you need to place the bricks evenly apart with mortar between each brick. With just bricks and no mortar, the wall won't have any "glue" holding it together. It will be unstable and collapse. The same is true if you just use the focus mode. You need to take a break and look at the big picture to place mortar and allow it to dry. If you only use the diffuse mode, you won't know how to do specific problems and will only understand the general idea. It's like trying to build a wall when you don't have enough bricks.

## Procrastination 

Procrastination shares features with addiction and is your brain's attempt to switch your mental attention away from something painful. When you think of studying, you get an unhappy feeling and your mind tries to distract you to do something else so you feel happy temporarily. This affect often snowballs.

Whenever you find yourself procrastinating, try to identify the cues that cause it and create a plan to redirect it into a cue for something productive, i.e a healthy habit.

### Habit := when you don't have to think about doing a task; doing it is automatic.

In order to create healthy habits, we need to understand what our procratination habits are and rewire them. We can do this by breaking down the components a habit is comprised of:

#### Cue := triggers an event

A cue could be in any of the following:
  
  Location/surroundings (in your room, look something up on the web, etc.)
  
  Time of day (getting home from work/school, just waking up, etc.)
  
  Feeling (tired, hungry, etc.)
  
Try identifing your personal procrastination cues.
  
#### Routine := a sequence of actions taken when a cue is received.

  Once you discover a procrastination cue, plan to rewire old habits by doing something productive in response to the cue. 

#### Reward := the reward system in your brain is activated when finished the routine 

  If you succeed at rewiring a procrastination cue, give yourself a reward after you finish the task. It can be as simple as a feeling of pride, making it a personal game, or anything you want (within reason).
  
#### Belief := A set of principles that help us understand our situation. There must be a change in your belief to change your habit.

  Believe you can do it. Don't give up if at first you don't succeed. 
  
## Process vs. Product

### Process := the flow of time and habits associated with it (spend 30 minutes doing homework problems)
### Product := the end result (e.g finishing homework, becoming a doctor)

When you focus on the product, i.e finishing your homework, the end result may seem far from being achieved and it can be discouraging. Instead, focus on spending chunks of time spending your best effort working on problems. Each chunk of time you spend focusing during a process is a success and is worthy of a small reward. More on this later.

## Sleep & Exercise

Remember earlier when I mentioned spaced repetition is more effective than binge studying in the same day? This is because sleep restructures and tidies concepts, rehearses patterns, and washes away toxins in our brain. Getting enough sleep is very important! Dreaming about concepts you're trying to learn solidifies them. To take full advantage of this, study 30 minutes before going to bed.

Exercising is beneficial because it increases the growth of new neurons.

## Plan Ahead

Every evening, write 'process' tasks for the next day. 

Plan a quit time! There is a high chance of feeling burnt out of you don't plan what time you will stop.

Work on the most disliked tasks first

# Methods of Learning

## Create Tools For Your Toolbox

Exercises in creativity like creating metaphors, analogies, and mnemonics can help make it stick.

#### Metaphors can link two ideas and help identify similarities between them. 

#### Analogies are a great way to explain the unfamiliar by using an example that is familiar.

#### Memory Palace := call to mind an area you're familiar with to learn unrealated lists
 
 ex. imagine objects in areas of the place. try to make it funny and evocative. you can mix it up further by imagining sounds and smells

#### Mnemonics := Link concepts together with a memorable sentence, phrase, word, poem, or even an image.

  eg. Learn the colors of the color spectrum by remembering the name ROY G. BIV. Each letter represents the first letter of the color in the spectrum: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.

#### Imagine imagery associated with acronyms:

  eg. imagine Roy G. Biv standing at the end of a rainbow

A common theme of these methods is that you chunk many words into one idea. This brings us to our next section:   

## Chunking := grouping information with meaning.

An example is walking. Walking requires many parts of your body to be accomplished, but it can be done with one thought. We have "chunked" how to walk. 

When you call to mind a chunk of information, you remember everything needed to accomplish it. All of the muscles required to walk automatically coordinate together to achieve the motion. If you have ever played the game QWOP, I imagine trying to run without our ability to chunk to be a little bit like that. If you haven't played the game, google it and try playing to see what I mean.

Remember that working memory can usually only store 4 parts at a time. Chunked material only requires one slot so the brain can run more efficiently.

Pattern to create chunks: listen, watch, and grasp parts of what needed and then join them together. Look at the solution and see why each step was taken in that order. Don't tunnel vision on a specific answer, but generalize connections between the steps. 

Chunking is different depending on what you're learning, but in general it follows the pattern above.

Allow concepts to network among themselves. Gadually build the number of chunks in your mind and create a library of patterns

transfer := using chunks already built to learn new things

## Problem Solving

There are two types of problem solving:

Sequential := step by step solutions

Holistic := intuition, creative, unrelated thoughts. 

## Change Locations

Sometimes if you study in the same location regularly, you can only remember information at that location because of environmental queues. You want to be able to recall information regardless of where you are like when you are writing an exam. Make sure to change where you study!

## Deliberate Practice

Practice what you don't have a solid grasp of and what you find difficult. Overlearning material you are familar with is easy and not a good use of study time. 

## Eat Your Biggest Frogs First

Do your hardest task first. Mark Twain once said "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first."

## Knowledge Restructuring

If you find that sometimes you hit a brick wall in learning and you're unable to learn, don't worry this is normal and can occur temporarily. It is thought that the brain is restructuring during this time.

## Picture walk (Diffuse Mode)

When reading something for the first time, do a picture walk of the material. If you are reading a chapter, skim ahead and look at the general theme of the chapter. Look at the pictures, read the headings and bolded text, and get an idea of what you're about to learn. The goal isn't to understand everything. You are just trying to become familiar with the material. When you actually read the chapter, you may find it easier to see how the details fit into the theme of the chapter.

## Read and Recall (Focus Mode)

When you read material, try to recall the main points without looking. Write down what you can remember and compare it to the written material. The retrieval process enhances deep learning.

## Summarize (Focus Mode)

Summarizing is a great way to tie everything together and synthesize information into smaller chunks. It's a great way to create neural connections between ideas that are related.

### Illusions of Competency (Focus Mode)

Studies have shown that highlighting text can fool you into thinking you know the information you highlighted, when that may not be the case. Instead, test yourself on your knowledge by trying to recall the information without it in front of you.
  
Write notes in margins instead of highlighting
  
Recall information without notes in front of you 
  
Making mistakes are illusions of competency you have caught. 
  
Keep deliberately practicing

## Verify Answers (Focus Mode)

Check your answers as soon as you have completed them. Analyze the solution and always look at the big picture.

## Interleave (Focus Mode)

Once you have a basic understanding, practice jumping between different types of problems, concepts, and procedures. eg. skipping around to problems in different chapters. This mixes up your learning and builds flexibility and creativity. You may find surprising connections between different disciplines.

## Create Mock Test Environment (Both modes)

Creating mock tests are a great way to test your mastery of a subject once you feel you have a solid grasp. Create a mock test where you are timed, can't look at your notes, and the questions aren't in the same order that they were when you learned them. The closer you can make it to an exam setting, the more prepared you will feel during the actual exam.
  
## Putting it all together with Focus, Understand, and Concept (FUC)

1. Focus - Use limited spots in working memory towards learning objective (don't be distracted!)
          
         First time learning material? -> Picture Walk
         
         Familiar with the material? -> Create chunks
          
          
2. Understand - Understand basic ideas and do it yourself.

        Read and Recall
          
        Summarize
          
        Change locations
          
        Deliberately Practice
        
        Verify Answers
        
        Create Tools For Your Toolbox
      
        Eat Your Biggest Frogs First
          
3. Concept - Learn context of when to apply the concept you're learning (Practice with related and unrelated material)
          
          Interleave
          
          Recheck your answers as soon as you complete them and 
          
          Create Mock Test Environment

# Study Aids

## Pomodoro Technique:

The pomodoro technique is used to learn something new while avoiding procrastination. 

In summary, it requires cycles of concentrated studying for a period of time, followed by a short break, and then a small reward. 

Before you begin, minimize the distractions around you. 

If it's possible, go to a quiet place and remove anything distracting from your study space, especially devices. 

During the pomodoro, your focus should be on spending your best effort actively learning for 25 minutes. 

Your focus should not be about the end result because you may not be able to complete your task in 25 minutes. Tasks will become complete as a side effect of doing enough pomodoro's.

Note: Requires a timer*. 

*If you don't have a timer, search online or look for a pomodoro timer app.

How it works:

1. Start a timer countdown for 25 minutes.

2. Actively focus on learning during the 25 minutes. More on learning techniques later.

3. After the 25 minutes is done, start a timer countdown for 5 minutes and use that time as a break to do something you enjoy.

4. Congratulations, you completed a pomodoro. If you want to do another, go to step 1.

Additional Notes:

If you get distracted during your pomodoro for an extended period of time, restart the timer and start over. That one didn't count.

If you remember to do something important that can wait until after the pomodoro, make a note of it and go back to focusing on studying. 

## Tasks List

Before the end of each day you should write tasks for the next day. 

1. Start small with a list you know you can do.

2. Each task should focus on a process and not the product. (Ex. Tasks like "Read for 1 hour" instead of "Read chapter 1")

3. Include a start time and a time where you will quit as well! 

4. Eat your biggest frog first

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Things to avoid

Don't create concept maps until you have a solid understanding.

Highlighting has been shown to not be very effective. Synthesize instead of highlighting. 

Don't practice what you already know! Overlearning is a waste of time and can lead to Einstellung := set in the same mindset due to overlearning

## Preparing for a Test Checklist
Have you made an effort to understand the text?

Have you worked on all homework problems and checked solutions? Have you compared with a classmate?

Have you participated in discussions with T.A or classmates when stuck?

Did you understand all homework solutions and ask if you didn't understand something?

Did you go through study guide alone? Did you then go through it with a classmate?

Did you outlines a lot of problems quickly w/o going into algebraic solutions?

Did you sleep properly?

## Writing a Test

NOTE: checklist only applies if you have prepared sufficiently for the test (see above)

For multiple choice questions, cover the answers first and think of an answer. 

1. Start with reading each problem so your brain subconsciously tackles it. (Diffuse mode)

2. Tackle what you perceive as the hardest first (Focus mode). Spend 1-2 minutes on it and then start something different.

3. Go to the easiest one and complete/almost complete it and move on. (Focus Mode on easy question/Diffuse mode on hard question)

4. Go to a unvisited hard one. Spend 1-2 minutes and move on.

5. Go to a unvisited easy one. Complete/almost complete it and move on.

6. Repeat steps 4-5 until you have attempted every question.

7. Go back and complete each question as best as you can.

To use the above test plan, you must have self discipline to move onto another question. Make sure to practice this technique in a mock test setting until you are familiar with it. The point of this method is to have your brain switch between diffuse and focused modes during the test. You may find that an answer to a previous question may come to you while you're answering another question (A "Eureka!" momemt). Step one forces you to subconsciously process every question even while you're focusing on a particular question in the later steps. This method optimizes the use of your brain during a test. If you've ever had a Eureka moment after you've already handed in your test, you could probably benefit from this method.
