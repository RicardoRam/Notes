# Background Information

## Modes of Learning

There are two modes of thinking called the Focus mode and the Diffuse mode defined in bold below. 
In order to learn, you must be able to switch between both modes.

### Diffuse Mode := type of thinking required to learn something new (broad learning)

Your mind can enter the diffused mode by taking a step back and looking at the big picture of what you're trying to learn. 
The goal is to get a general feel of what you're trying to learn without looking at all the intricate details.

Methods:
  1. Look at the big picture, not the details.
  2. Picture walk := when reading a new chapter or section, skim ahead and look at the pictures and main ideas. 

### Focus Mode := type of thinking needed to solve a problem step by step

Your mind can enter the focused mode when you try to solve a specific problem and look at all details required to solve the problem.

An analogy may be helpful for understanding why you need to switch between the modes of learning. To make a strong wall, you need to place the bricks evenly apart with mortar between each brick. With just bricks and no mortar, the wall won't have any "glue" holding it together. It will be unstable and collapse. The same is true if you just use the focus mode. You need to take a break and look at the big picture to place mortar and allow it to dry. If you only use the diffuse mode, you won't know how to do specific problems and will only understand the general idea. It's like trying to build a wall when you don't have enough bricks.

## Memory (ToDo)

### Working memory := typically stores 3-4 chunks temporarily. It is like an inefficient mental blackboard where chalk fades over time.

### Long term memory := stores memory long term (not indefinitely). May take time to access memory that wasn't learned through spaced repetition.

### Spaced Repetition := practicing the learning the same concept over several days

You must use spaced repetition to transfer memories from working memory into long term memory. 
It is better to study something 20 times spaced out across a week instead of 20 times within a single day. 

## Procrastination 

Procrastination shares features with addiction and is an attempt to switch your mental attention away from something painful. When you think of studying you get an unhappy feeling so your mind tries to distract you into do something else so you feel happy temporarily. This affect often snowballs.

Whenever you find yourself procrastinating, try to identify the cues that cause it and create a plan to redirect it into a cue for something productive. 

1. A cue could be in any of the following categories
  - location/surroundings (in your room, look something up on the web, ...)
  - time of day (getting home from work/school)
  - how you feel (horny, tired, etc.)
  - reactions (receiving a text)
2. Once you discover a procrastination cue, plan to rewire old habits by doing something productive in response to the cue. 
3. If you succeed at rewiring a procrastination cue, give yourself a reward after you finish the task. It can be as simple as a feeling of pride, making it a personal game, or anything you want.
4. believe you can do it. Don't give up if at first you don't succeed.

## Sleep and Exercise

Remember earlier when I mentioned spaced repetition is more effective than binge studying in the same day? This is because sleep restructures and tidies concepts, rehearses patterns, and washes away toxins in our brain. Getting enough sleep is very important!

Exercising is beneficial because it can increase the growth of new neurons.

## Habit (ToDo)

# Methods of Learning

## Metaphors, Analogies, and Mnemonics (ToDo)

## Chunking

Chunking is uniting bits of information with meaning. (ex. walking requires many parts of your body to be accomplished, but it can be done with one thought. We have "chunked" how to walk)

Remember that the working memory can usually only store 4 parts at a time. Chunked material only requires one slot so the brain can run more efficiently.

## Process not Product

### Process := the flow of time and habits associated with it (ex. spend 30 minutes working on problems)

### Product := end results (ex. finishing your homework, becoming a doctor, etc.)

When you focus on the product, i.e finishing your homework, the end result may seem far from being achieved and it can be discouraging. Instead, focus on spending chunks of time spending your best effort working on problems. Each chunk of time you spend focusing during a process is a success and is worthy of a small reward. More on this below.

## Change locations

Sometimes if you study in the same location regularly, you can only remember information because of environmental queues. You want to be able to recall information independently of local queues like in an examination room. To do this, try studying in different locations.

## Deliberate Practice

Practice what you don't have a solid grasp of and what you find difficult. Overlearning material you are familar with is easy and not a good use of study time. 

## Eat Your Biggest Frogs First

Do your hardest task first. Mark Twain once said "If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first."

## Verify Answers (Focus Mode) (ToDo)

## Recall (Focus Mode)

When you read material, try to recall the main points without looking. Write down what you can remember and compare it to the written material. The retrieval process enhances deep learning.

## Summarize (Focus Mode)

Summarizing is a great way to tie everything together and synthesize information into smaller chunks. It's a great way to create neural connections between ideas that are related.

## Interleaving (ToDo)


## Picture walk (Diffuse Mode)

When reading something for the first time, do a picture walk of the material. If you are reading a chapter, skim ahead and look at the general theme of the chapter. Look at the pictures, read the headings and bolded text, and get an idea of what you're about to learn. The goal isn't to understand everything. You are just trying to become familiar with the material. When you actually read the chapter, you may find it easier to see how the details fit into the theme of the chapter.

## Create and do mock tests (Both modes) (ToDo)
  
## Putting it all together with Focus, Understand, and Concept (FUC)

1. Focus - Use limited spots in working memory towards learning objective (don't be distracted!)
          
          First time learning material -> Picture Walk
          Familiar with the material -> Create chunks
          
          
2. Understand - Understand basic ideas and do it yourself.

        Read and Recall
          
        Summarize
          
        Change locations
          
        Deliberately practice
      
        Eat your largest frogs first
          
3. Concept - Learn context of when to apply the concept you're learning (Practice with related and unrelated material)
          
          Interleaving - practice jumping between different types of problems, concepts, and procedures. (ex. skipping between problem sets of different chapters).
          
          Recheck your answers as soon as you complete them and 
          
          Mixing up your learning builds flexibility and creativity. You may find surprising connections between different disciplines.
          
          Create a mock test environment where you are timed, can't look at your notes, and the questions aren't in the same order that they were when you learned them.

# Study Techniques

## Pomodoro Technique:

The pomodoro technique is used to learn something new while avoiding procrastination. 
In summary, it requires cycles of concentrated studying for a period of time, followed by a short break, and then a small reward. 
Before you begin, minimize the distractions around you. 
If it's possible, go to a quiet place and remove anything distracting from your study space, especially devices. 
During the pomodoro, your focus should be on spending your best effort actively learning for 25 minutes. 
Your focus should not be about the end result because you may not be able to complete your task in 25 minutes. Tasks will become complete as a side effect of doing enough pomodoro's.

Note: Requires a timer*. 

*If you don't have a timer, search online or in an app store for "Pomodoro timer".

How it works:

1. Start a timer countdown for 25 minutes.

2. Actively focus on learning during the 25 minutes. More on learning techniques later.

3. After the 25 minutes is done, start a timer countdown for 5 minutes and use that time as a break to do something you enjoy.

4. Congratulations, you completed a pomodoro. If you want to do another, go to step 1.

Additional Notes:

If you get distracted during your pomodoro for an extended period of time, restart the timer and start over. That one didn't count.

If you remember to do something important that can wait until after the pomodoro, make a note of it and go back to focusing on studying. 

## Tasks List

Every evening you should write tasks for the next day. 
1. Start small with a list you know you can do.
2. Each task should focus on a process and not the product. (Ex. Tasks like "Read for 1 hour" instead of "Read chapter 1")
3. Include a start time and a time where you will quit as well! 
4. Eat your biggest frog first

# Things to avoid

Don't create concept maps until you have a solid understanding.

Highlighting has been shown to not be very effective. Synthesize instead of highlighting. 

Don't practice what you already know! Overlearning is a waste of time and can lead to einstellung (set in the same mindset due to overlearning)


# Preparing for and Writing a Test

## Preparing for a test checklist
- Have you made an effort to understand the text?
- Have you worked on all homework problems and checked solutions? Have you compared with a classmate?
- Have you participated in discussions with T.A or classmates when stuck?
- Did you understand all homework solutions and ask if you didn't understand something?
- Did you go through study guide alone? Did you then go through it with a classmate?
- Did you outlines a lot of problems quickly w/o going into algebraic solutions?
- Did you sleep properly?

## Writing a test

NOTE: checklist only applies if you have prepared sufficiently for the test (see above)

For multiple choice questions, cover the answers first and think of an answer. 

1. Start with reading each problem (Uses Diffuse mode) so your brain subconsciously tackles it.
2. Tackle what you perceive as the hardest first. Spend 1-2 minutes on it and then start something different.
3. Go to the easiest one and complete/almost complete it and move on.
4. Go to a different hard one. Spend 1-2 minutes and move on.
5. Go to a different easy one. Complete/almost complete it and move on.
6. repeat steps 4-5 until you have attempted every question.
7. Go back and complete each question as best as you can.

To use the above test plan, you must have self discipline to move onto another question. Make sure to practice this technique in a mock test setting until you are familiar with it. The point of this method is to have your brain switch between diffuse and focused modes during the test. You may find that an answer to a previous question may come to you while you're answering another question (A "Eureka!" momemt).
