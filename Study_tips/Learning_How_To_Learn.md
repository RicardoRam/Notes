# Background Information

## Modes of Learning

There are two modes of thinking called the Focus mode and the Diffuse mode defined in bold below. 
In order to learn, you must be able to switch between both modes.

### Diffuse Mode := type of thinking required to learn something new (broad learning)

Your mind can enter the diffused mode by taking a step back and looking at the big picture of what you're trying to learn. 
The goal is to get a general feel of what you're trying to learn without looking at all of the details that complicate it.

Methods:
  1. Look at the big picture, not the details.
  2. Picture walk := when reading a new chapter or section, skim ahead and look at the pictures and main ideas. 

### Focus Mode := type of thinking needed to solve a problem step by step

Your mind can enter the focused mode when you try to solve a specific problem and look at all details required to solve the problem.


An analogy for modes of learning := To make a wall, you need ...

## Working Memory (ToDo)
## Procrastination (ToDo)

Procrastination shares features wiht addiction. When you think of studying you get an unhappy feeling so your mind tries to distract you to feel happy temporarily. This affect often snowballs.

Whenever you find yourself procrastinating, try to identify the cues that cause it and create a plan to redirect it into a cue for something productive. 

1. A cue could be in any of the following categories
  - location/surroundings (in your room, look something up on the web, ...)
  - time of day (getting home from work/school)
  - how you feel (horny, tired, etc.)
  - reactions (receiving a text)
2. Once you discover a procrastination cue, plan to rewire old habits by doing something productive in response to the cue. 
3. If you succeed at rewiring a procrastination cue, give yourself a reward after you finish the task. It can be as simple as a feeling of pride, making it a personal game, or anything you want.
4. believe you can do it. Don't give up if at first you don't succeed.

# Methods of Learning

## Chunking

Chunking is uniting bits of information with meaning. (ex. walking requires many parts of your body to be accomplished, but it can be done with one thought. We have "chunked" how to walk)

Remember that the working memory can usually only store 4 parts at a time. Chunked material only requires one slot so the brain can run more efficiently.


## Recall
## Process not Product
## 

## Putting it all together with Focus, Understand, and Concept (FUC)

1. Focus - Use limited spots in working memory towards learning objective (don't be distracted!)
          
          When beginning to learn, do a picture walk of the material
          Once you are familiar with the material, try to create chunks to use working memory efficiently.
          
          
2. Understand - Understand basic ideas and do it yourself.

      Read and then recall information (retrieval process enchances deep learning)
          
      Write summarizing notes in the margins (synthesize information into smaller chunks)
          
      Recall information in different locations (Want to remember independant of local queues)
          
      Deliberately practice what you don't have a solid grasp of and what you find difficult.
      
      Do your hardest task first. Mark Twain once said "If it's your hob to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first."

          
3. Concept - Learn context of when to apply the concept you're learning (Practice with related and unrelated material)
          
          Interleaving - practice jumping between different types of problems, concepts, and procedures. (ex. skipping between problem sets of different chapters).
          
          Recheck your answers as soon as you complete them and 
          
          Mixing up your learning builds flexibility and creativity. You may find surprising connections between different disciplines.
          
          Create a mock test environment where you are timed, can't look at your notes, and the questions aren't in the same order that they were when you learned them.

# Study Techniques

## Pomodoro Technique:

The pomodoro technique is used to learn something new while avoiding procrastination. 
In summary, it requires cycles of concentrated studying for a period of time, followed by a short break, and then a small reward. 
Before you begin, minimize the distractions around you. 
If it's possible, go to a quiet place and remove anything distracting from your study space, especially devices. 
During the pomodoro, your focus should be on spending your best effort actively learning for 25 minutes. 
Your focus should not be about the end result because you may not be able to complete your task in 25 minutes. Tasks will become complete as a side effect of doing enough pomodoro's.

Note: Requires a timer*. 

*If you don't have a timer, search online or in an app store for "Pomodoro timer".

How it works:

1. Start a timer countdown for 25 minutes.

2. Actively focus on learning during the 25 minutes. More on learning techniques later.

3. After the 25 minutes is done, start a timer countdown for 5 minutes and use that time as a break to do something you enjoy.

4. Congratulations, you completed a pomodoro. If you want to do another, go to step 1.

Additional Notes:

If you get distracted during your pomodoro for an extended period of time, restart the timer and start over. That one didn't count.

If you remember to do something important that can wait until after the pomodoro, make a note of it and fo back to focusing on studying. 

## Tasks List

Every evening you should write tasks for the next day. 
1. Start small with a list you know you can do.
2. Each task should focus on a process and not the product. (Ex. Tasks like "Read for 1 hour" instead of "Read chapter 1")
3. Include a start time and a time where you will quit as well! 
4. Eat your biggest frog first

# Things to avoid and helpful tips

Retrieve, don't keep rereading text

Don't create concept maps until you have a solid understanding.

Synthesize instead of highlighting.

Don't practice what you already know! Overlearning is a waste of time and can lead to einsetllung (set in the same mindset due to overlearning)
